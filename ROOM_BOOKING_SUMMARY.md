# Room Booking System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A complete room booking system integrated with Microsoft Graph API for synchronizing bookings with Microsoft 365 resource calendars.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema (Prisma)
- ✅ Added `Room` model with fields:
  - Basic info: name, capacity, location
  - Microsoft integration: `msResourceEmail` (resource mailbox)
  - Pricing: `hourlyRateCents`
  - Status: `active` flag
- ✅ Added `Booking` model with:
  - Room and user relations
  - Time range: start/end datetimes
  - Status: PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED
  - Graph sync: `msEventId`, `msICalUid`
  - Metadata: createdBy, updatedBy
- ✅ Added enums: `IdentityProvider`, `UserStatus`, `BookingStatus`
- ✅ Updated `User` model with bookings relation and new fields

### 2. Microsoft Graph Integration
- ✅ Created `lib/graph.ts` - Graph API client using MSAL Client Credentials flow
- ✅ Created `lib/availability.ts` - Availability checking with `getSchedule` API
- ✅ Token acquisition with automatic refresh
- ✅ Error handling and fallback when Graph is not configured

### 3. API Endpoints

**User Endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /api/rooms` - List all active rooms (merged from DB + Graph)
- ✅ `POST /api/bookings` - Create booking with conflict checking
- ✅ `GET /api/bookings` - List user's bookings (with filters)
- ✅ `GET /api/bookings/[id]` - Get specific booking
- ✅ `PATCH /api/bookings/[id]` - Update booking
- ✅ `DELETE /api/bookings/[id]` - Cancel booking

**Admin Endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/rooms` - List all rooms with stats
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/rooms` - Create room
- ✅ `PATCH /api/admin/rooms/[id]` - Update room
- ✅ `DELETE /api/admin/rooms/[id]` - Delete room (with safety checks)

### 4. Business Logic

**Booking Validation:**
- ✅ Prevents past bookings
- ✅ Validates start < end
- ✅ Local database conflict checking
- ✅ Microsoft Graph availability checking
- ✅ Graceful degradation when Graph unavailable

**Booking Flow:**
1. Validate input (Zod schemas)
2. Check local overlaps
3. Check Graph availability (if configured)
4. Create booking in DB (PENDING)
5. Sync to Graph event in resource mailbox
6. Update status to CONFIRMED
7. Store Graph event IDs for future sync
8. Log audit trail

**Update/Cancel Flow:**
- Update/cancel in database
- Sync changes to Graph event
- Handle Graph failures gracefully
- Full audit trail

### 5. Admin UI
- ✅ Admin rooms list page (`/admin/rooms`)
- ✅ Add new room page (`/admin/rooms/new`)
- ✅ Card-based UI showing:
  - Room details
  - Active status
  - Booking count
  - Edit/Delete actions
- ✅ Updated admin dashboard with "Zalen & Vergaderruimtes" section

### 6. Docker Configuration
- ✅ Created `docker/Dockerfile` (multi-stage build)
- ✅ Created `docker/entrypoint.sh` (migrations + server start)
- ✅ Created `.dockerignore`
- ✅ Created `docker-compose.dev.yml` for local development
- ✅ Health check endpoint configuration
- ✅ Supports standalone Next.js output

### 7. Documentation
- ✅ Created `ROOM_BOOKING_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- ✅ Created `ROOM_BOOKING_SUMMARY.md` - This document
- ✅ Included Azure AD setup steps
- ✅ API documentation with examples
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Docker deployment instructions

### 8. Audit Trail
- ✅ Added booking actions to audit log types:
  - `BOOKING_CREATED`
  - `BOOKING_UPDATED`
  - `BOOKING_CANCELLED`
  - `ROOM_CREATED`
  - `ROOM_UPDATED`
  - `ROOM_DELETED`
- ✅ All booking operations log audit trail

## 🔄 Partially Implemented (Needs Completion)

### 1. External User Authentication
- ⚠️ Email magic link provider not yet added to NextAuth
- ⚠️ TOTP enrollment flow not implemented
- ⚠️ User status management (INVITED, ACTIVE, SUSPENDED)
- **Next Steps:**
  - Add Email provider to `lib/auth-options.ts`
  - Create `/enroll/2fa` page
  - Implement TOTP verification on login

### 2. Privacy Masking for External Users
- ⚠️ Availability queries don't mask internal event details for externals
- **Next Steps:**
  - Modify availability endpoints to filter event details
  - Show only BUSY status for non-owned events
  - Show full details for user's own bookings

### 3. User Booking UI
- ⚠️ No UI for users to browse and book rooms
- **Next Steps:**
  - Create `/rooms` page with room list
  - Create booking form with time picker
  - Create `/my-bookings` page to view user's bookings
  - Calendar view integration

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Implementation

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Set DATABASE_URL first
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_room_booking_models
```

### 2. Configure Azure AD
- Follow steps in `ROOM_BOOKING_SETUP.md`
- Get tenant ID, client ID, and client secret
- Add to `.env`

### 3. Create Resource Mailboxes
- Create in Exchange Admin Center
- Map emails to rooms in admin UI

### 4. Build User Interface
- Create `/rooms` page for browsing and booking
- Add calendar view for availability
- Create booking form
- Add "My Bookings" page

### 5. Add External User Auth
- Implement email magic link
- Add TOTP enrollment
- Add 2FA verification

### 6. Test the Integration
```bash
# Start local dev
npm run dev

# Test booking flow
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"roomId":"...","title":"Test","start":"...","end":"..."}'
```

## 📊 API Usage Examples

  -d '{
    "name": "Conference Room A",
    "capacity": 20,
    "location": "Floor 3",
    "msResourceEmail": "room-a@company.com",
    "hourlyRateCents": 1000,
    "active": true
  }'
```

### Book a Room
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "roomId": "clx...",
    "title": "Team Standup",
    "start": "2024-01-15T14:00:00Z",
    "end": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    "attendeeEmails": ["colleague@company.com"]
  }'
```

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database migration runs successfully
- [ ] Rooms can be created via admin UI
- [ ] Bookings can be created without Graph
- [ ] Availability check works with Graph
- [ ] Booking creates event in Graph
- [ ] Booking update syncs to Graph
- [ ] Booking cancellation removes Graph event

- [ ] Admin permissions enforced
- [ ] Docker build succeeds
- [ ] Production deployment works

## 📝 Notes

- **Timezone**: All times are stored in UTC, displayed in user's timezone
- **Graph Integration**: Optional - app works without Graph but without sync
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks on Graph failures
- **Security**: All endpoints require authentication
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple tenants via AllowedTenant table

## 🤝 Contributing
